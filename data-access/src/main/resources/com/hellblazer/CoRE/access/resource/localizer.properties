no-persistence-unit-param: Missing <b>persistence.unit</b> parameter. JEST Servlet must be \
	configured with a parameter named <b>persistence.unit<b> in &lt;init-param&gt; clause \
	of &lt;servlet&gt; declaration in <code>WEB-INF/web.xml</code> descriptor.
servlet-init: JEST Servlet is initialized for "{0}" persistence unit.
servlet-not-init: JEST Servlet can not find "{0}" persistence unit during servlet initialization. \
    JEST Servlet will try to locate the unit when a request is to be served.
    
no-persistence-unit: JEST can not locate the component using persistence unit {0}. This can happen \
    for several reasons: \r\n\
    a) the component using persistence unit {0} is not initialized. \r\n\
    b) the component using persistence unit {0} and JEST servlet do not belong to the same deployment module \r\n\
    c) the component did not configure the persistence unit for pooling. To enable pooling, \
    create the persistence unit with configuration property openjpa.EntityManagerFactoryPool set to true. \r\n\
    The property must be passed to Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(String unit, Map props) \
    with the Map argument and not via META-INF/persistence.xml.
      
no-persistence-unit-standalone: JEST can not create persistence unit {0} in standalone mode.

resource-not-found: Can not locate resource {0}. <br>This can happen for wrong URI syntax. See \
<A href="http://openjpa.apache.org/jest-syntax.html" target="_blank">JEST URI Help page</A> for correct syntax.

query-execution-error: Error executing query "{0}". See stacktrace for details.
parse-invalid-qualifier: {0} command does not recognize "{1}" as a qualifier. Valid qualifiers are {2}.
parse-missing-mandatory-argument: {0} command must have "{1}" argument. Available arguments are {2}.
parse-less-argument: {0} command must have at least {2} arguments. Available arguments are {1}.
