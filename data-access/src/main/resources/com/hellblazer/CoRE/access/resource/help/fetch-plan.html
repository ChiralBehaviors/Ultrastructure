<h3>Dynamic Fetch Plan</h3>

Specify one or more named fetch plan. Separate multiple names with comma, e.g.
<p align="center">
myPlanA, mYPlanB 
</p> 
There are two pre-defined plans named: <b>default</b> and <b>all</b>. The <b>default</b> plan that fetches
all properties of basic type (i.e. <tt>String, int, Date</tt> etc.) and uni-cardinality relations, are 
active by default. As the plans are additive, to exclude the default plan, you can specify
<p align="center">
myPlanA, -default
</p> 


Fetch Plan determines which properties will be fetched when an entity instance is accessed from the data store.
A plan can traverse relationship path into other entities at arbitrary depth. By default, when an entity
is fetched, all properties of basic type (i.e. <tt>String, int, Date</tt> etc.) and uni-cardinality relations are
fetched. 
<br>
JPA specification allows <tt>@Fetch.LAZY</tt> and <tt>@Fetch.EAGER</tt> annotation on persistent properties to control 
fetch behavior. But only <em>statically</em> i.e. at class definition. 
<p>
OpenJPA, on the other hand, provides a far richer syntax and semantics to its user to define the
properties to be fetched through its dynamic Fetch Plan facility. And, more importantly, these
fetch plans can be modified <em>dynamically</em> per use case basis.
