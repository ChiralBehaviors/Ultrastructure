/**
 * Provides an implementation of consistent hashing. Consistent hashing has been
 * introduced in <blockquote>
 * <P>
 * Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for
 * Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web, by David R. Karger, Eric Lehman,
 * Frank T. Leighton, Rina Panigrahy, Matthew S. Levine and Daniel Lewin, Proc.
 * of the twenty-ninth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing, El Paso,
 * Texas, United States, 1997, pages 654&minus;663. </blockquote> This class
 * provides some extension to the original definition: weighted buckets and
 * skippable buckets. More precisely, keys are distributed on buckets
 * proportionally to the weight of the buckets, and it is possible to specify a
 * {@linkplain SkipStrategy skip strategy} for buckets.
 * 
 * <H3>Consistent Hash Function: Properties</H3>
 * 
 * <P>
 * A consistent hash function consists, at any time, of a set of objects, called
 * <em>buckets</em>, each with a specified weight (a positive integer). At the
 * beginning, there are no buckets, but you can
 * {@linkplain #add(Comparable, int) add a new bucket}, or
 * {@linkplain #remove(Comparable) remove an existing bucket}.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The method {@link #hash(long)} can be used to hash a <em>point</em> (a long)
 * to a bucket. More precisely, when applied to a given point, this method will
 * return one of the buckets, and the method will satisfy the following
 * properties:
 * 
 * <OL>
 * <LI>the bucket returned by {@link #hash(long)} is one of the buckets
 * currently present in the consistent hash function;
 * <LI>the fraction of points that are hashed to a specific bucket is
 * approximately proportional to the weight of the bucket; for example, if there
 * are only two buckets <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, and the weight of
 * <var>A</var> is 2 whereas the weight of <var>B</var> is 3, then about 2/5 of
 * all longs will be hashed to <var>A</var> and about 3/5 will be hashed to
 * <var>B</var>;
 * <LI>every time you add a new bucket, some of the points will of course be
 * hashed to the new bucket, but it is impossible that a point that was hashed
 * to an old bucket will now be hashed to some other old bucket; more formally,
 * consider the following sequence of instructions:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Object A = chf.hash(x);
 * chf.add(B);
 * Object C = chf.hash(x);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * at the end either <code>A==C</code> (i.e., the hash of x has not changed
 * after adding B), or <code>C==B</code> (i.e., now x is hashed to the new
 * object).
 * </OL>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Otherwise said, if a new bucket is added, then the number of keys that change
 * their assignment is the minimum necessary; more importantly, it is impossible
 * that a key changes its bucket assignment towards a bucket that already
 * existed: when a bucket is added old buckets can only lose keys towards the
 * new bucket.
 * 
 * <P>
 * It is easy to see that the last property stated above can be equivalently
 * stated by saying that every point determines a (total) order among buckets;
 * the {@link #hash(long)} method only returns the first element of this order.
 * It is also possible, using {@link #hash(long, int)} to obtain an
 * <em>array</em> of buckets containing the (first part of the) order. In
 * particular, if the latter method is called with a specified length
 * corresponding to the number of buckets, the whole order will be returned.
 * 
 * <H3>Implementation Details</H3>
 * 
 * <P>
 * With each bucket, we associate a number of points, called replicae, located
 * on the unit circle (the unit circle itself is represented approximately on
 * the whole range of <code>long</code>s). Then, given a point <var>p</var>, one
 * can {@linkplain #hash(long) get the bucket} corresponding to the replica that
 * is closest to <var>p</var>.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The method that {@linkplain #hash(long, int) gets an array} containing the
 * buckets looks at the buckets that are closest to a point, in distance order,
 * without repetitions. In particular, by computing an array as large as the
 * number of buckets, you will obtain a permutation of the buckets themselves.
 * Indeed, another viewpoint on consistent hashing is that it associates a
 * random permutation of the buckets to each point (albeit the interpretation of
 * weights, in that case, becomes a bit twisted).
 * 
 * <P>
 * The number of replicas associated to a bucket is fixed when the bucket is
 * inserted in the map. The actual number depends on the weight and on the
 * constant {@link #replicaePerBucket}.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class handles overlaps (i.e., conflicts in a replica creation). In that
 * case, a local deterministic ordering is generated using the hash code (and,
 * in case of a tie, the lexicographic order of string representation) of the
 * buckets.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The hashing function is deterministically based on the hash code of the
 * buckets, which should be of good quality. This is essential to ensure
 * deterministic replicability of the results of this function across different
 * instances.
 *

     * because any change requires removing or adding
     * {@link ConsistentHashFunction#replicaePerBucket} replicae).
