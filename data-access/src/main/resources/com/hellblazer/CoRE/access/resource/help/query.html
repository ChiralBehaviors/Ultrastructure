<h3>JPQL Query</h3>

Specify a JPQL query or name of a pre-defined NamedQuery.
<br>
Both queries can accept query bind parameters. The type of the parameters are guessed by JEST
from the string you specify in this web form. 
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you use special characters such as '%' in the query, use them as binding parameter value.
For example, <b>do not</b> use query as<br>
<tt>select m from Movie m where m.title like '%CHINA%'</tt>
Instead use<br>
<tt>select m from Movie m where m.title like :title</tt>
<br>
and then set the value of named parameter <tt>title</tt> to <tt>%CHINA%</tt>
<p>
If using named query, check the Named Query Box.
